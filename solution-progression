The object is to outline the stages of solution I moved through as I tried to find a javascript solution to determine
the least common multiple of an array of integers. I am following the javascript curriculum at freecodecamp.com, and this
is one of the Bonifire challenges (Samllest Commons). I am severely math challenged, and so this problem was very difficult for me.
